Competing line change merge conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.

Removed file merge conflicts

To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing changes to a file, where a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file, you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit.
